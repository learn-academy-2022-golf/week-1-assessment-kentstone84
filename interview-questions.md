# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

<!-- Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS. -->


**1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?**

<!-- Your answer: Git is a software on my computer while Github is a cloud based service of version control that allows you to share seemlessly while working. 

Researched answer: Git allows you to push to GitHub to share code with a co-working partner while also keeping track of changes you or other developers have made before joining working code into the main line. There are other systems that work like Github such as Gogs and Gitbucket. 
Github also offers an amazing package to students over the age of 13 that allows access to popular development tools and service at no cost, my computer using git offers the occasional headache.  -->

**2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?**

<!-- Your answer: A Boolean value consists of True and False. In JavaScript there are two operators that will return a Boolean value, logical and comparison operatos. 

Researched answer: And, or, not or and not. >, <, >=, <=, ===, and !== are types of comparison operators while &&, ||, !, are logical operators. Comparison operators follow the same rules from math class, equal to or greater than, equal to or less than, equal to and Not equal to. Comparison operators allow us to assert the equality of a statement with JavaScript. We can check whether two values or expressions are equal with ===, or, whether one comparison is greater than another with >.  -->

**3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?**

<!-- Your answer: A index refers to the first page of a website in HTML but in JavaScript it refers to the position inside the element. 

Researched answer: Index rerfers to the position of the element inside of an array and is either a number or a piece of data with a number in it. In the Index, array elements are numbered starting at 0 and goes up from there.  -->

**4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.**

<!-- Your answer: An arrary and string are both used to get a single item from a line of data or code. The diffences between an array and string pulls out a single word while a string only pulls a single character. 

Researched answer: An array os a data structure that contains a group of elements within the same data type. A string is a object that outlines a series of characters. A array is either one or two dimensional but a string is limited to two dimensions. Arrays can be mutable while stings are immutable. A array can hold any data type but strings can hold only char data.  -->

**5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?**

<!-- Your answer: One person codes while the other person provides direction and tells the first person what to write. In pair Programming one person has hands on the keyboard while the second does not. The second person is watching and looking for possible errors and thinking of what direction the code will go and telling first person what goes into the code. 

Researched answer: Researched answer: Pair programming is a technique that allows two programmers to work on one project. One person is “driving” while the second person “navigates” and reviews each line of code as it goes in. The navigator takes more of a what direction are we headed and looks for possible problems while the driver is more focused on making the current line of code. The roles are swapped frequently so that neither one loses focus or gets burned out.   -->

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

<!-- 1. Higher Order Functions: Functions that operate on other functions by taking them as arguments or returning them. Higher-order functions allow us to  summerize actions, not just values. They come in several forms. Functions that use other functions as arguments or return functions are called Higher order functions. To be a function it must take a input and retun an output. Without a input and out put relationship it is not a function but perhaps a object or class or even just syntax.  -->


<!-- 2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript test framework that focuses on simple. It is used as a library for creating, running and structuring tests. That’s it! It starts with a describe block and takes two arguments, a string for describing the test and a callback function for wrapping the test. Jest can also run test in parallel while taking failed tests and reoganizes the runs based on how long it takes.  -->
<!-- 
describe("Filter function", () => {
  test("it should filter by a search term (link)", () => {
    // actual test
  });
}); -->


<!-- 3. Objects: Objects are one of six JavaScripts data types. It is used to store various key-value pairs that in turn are class a property. Objects are created with the Object() constructor or the object initializer. To build an object lets use mydog. let myDog = {firstName:'Jack' lastName:'Russel' } Using the key:value of firstName and lastName it becomes a object. When the object has multiple properties use a comma to seperate them. To access the firstName property of myDog object you use myDog.firstName.  -->


<!-- 4. Method: In the simplest way, a method is a function that belongs to a object or a set of instruction that preforms a task. A dog for example is a object and the things about it, fur, eye color, tail length are all its properties. The Method is an action on an object. To break it down a bit more lets const myDog. myDog has a firstName of Jack and lastName of Russel. His FullName function would be a method of the object. A method is acts as a function but only when associated with an object. Functions will live on their own but a method must be associated with a object property.  -->

<!-- 5. Classes: JavaScript initially did not have classes. Classes were only added in (ES6). Classes are a special type of function that are declard with a keyword started with an expression. Using my previous example of a dog, his name, color, tail length would be classes instead of prototypes. Prototypes were what JS used before ES6 to class the object. The class provides a more concise was of declaration using syntax that similar to the opject programming languages. If you do not use a declaration to access the class it will throw an error.  -->
